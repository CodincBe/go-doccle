# Doccler

A simple tool to use the (none-documented) api of Doccle.
This tool has as a sole purpose to automate administrational tasks as much as possible.

A perfect, and personally used, use-case of this tool is retrieving the documents from Doccle to store them
on a centralized location (hello G-Drive) which in turn can be monitored to push the documents to your accountant.
